<p>It is Ouino.app's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
    website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://www.Ouino.app">https://www.Ouino.app</a>
    (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://www.Ouino.app"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
    personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
    ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and
    under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
    information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and
    policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
    required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Ouino.app collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
    browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
    the date and time of each visitor request. Ouino.app's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
    information is to better understand how Ouino.app's visitors use its website. From time to time,
    Ouino.app may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on
    trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Ouino.app also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
    for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.Ouino.app blog posts. Ouino.app only
    discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
    personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to Ouino.app's websites choose to interact with Ouino.app in ways that require
    Ouino.app to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
    Ouino.app gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for
    https://www.Ouino.app to provide a username and email address.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
    Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
    protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Advertisements</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies
    allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
    information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
    deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the
    use of cookies by Ouino.app and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>


<h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
<p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you
    will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and
    conditions of every site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
    party sites, products or services.</p>

<h2>Https://www.Ouino.app uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
<p>Https://www.Ouino.app uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to
    previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on
    our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on
    the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use
    cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with
    our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>
<p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you
    can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Ouino.app discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
    its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process

    agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
    located outside of your home country; by using Ouino.app's website, you consent to the transfer of such
    information to them. Ouino.app will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
    as described above, Ouino.app discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
    information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Ouino.app
    believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ouino.app,
    third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of https://www.Ouino.app and have supplied your email address, Ouino.app may
    occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
    with what's going on with Ouino.app and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
    information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
    support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify
    or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ouino.app takes all measures reasonably
    necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
